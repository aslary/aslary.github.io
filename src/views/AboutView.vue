      <h1><u>Hiring</u></h1>
      <p>
        I am open for well paid jobs, if you are an employer and interested in my skills, contact me via my social media
        profiles (listed on the homepage). If I don't get any offers, I will most likely build my own company.
      </p>

      <h1><u>Education</u></h1>
      <p>
        As already mentioned in the home page, I am a computer scientist and content creator.
        Ever since I was a child, I was curious about how computers work.
        This interest reflected itself strongly in my educational path.
        I went to a technical college (called HTL in Austria) for computer science (now commonly called informatics).
        School education was not enough for me as I wanted to deepen my knowledge in areas such as software
        engineering.
        This was the reason why I attented the Technical University of Vienna in the faculty of Software and
        Information
        Engineering.
      </p>

      <h1><u>Career</u></h1>
      <p>
        Career-wise, I have done several internships at well established Austrian IT companies.
        In those, I primarily worked in the summer breaks, mostly on internal projects.
        The things I learned were valuable and quite interesting, a few of them even helped me during my studies.
      </p>

      <h1><u>My interests, skills and strengths</u></h1>
      <p>
        I am mostly interested in software engineering.
        This primarily includes classical web development with a clean and scalable architecture.
        Being visually creative was never my strength or goal, which is the reason why I feel more confident in doing
        backend-related tasks. Precision is my second name: I work clean and think of every malicious scenario when
        developing applications.<br><br>

        Other than web development, I also enjoy system related programming, primarily with C on GNU/Linux (I will abbrv.
        with Linux) systems.
        Linux is just a wonderful system, I have been using it ever since I graduated from school. I feel comfortable in
        the Debian/Ubuntu world.
        However, because Canonical has forced its users to consume snap packages, I cannot see myself using core Ubuntu
        any longer, I rather use its derivates.
        This is the reason for my permanent switch to Linux Mint, which is a cleaned up version of core Ubuntu with a more
        pleasing desktop environment.
        I have also tried RHEL or Arch based distros, but I don't like bleeding edge software.
        Having a new "improved" UI every few months is rather cumbersome for me.
        I want the same look and feel for as long as possible, while still getting security updates.
        Linux Mint just fits my needs.
        Sometimes, I am also using Windows, which I installed on a separate drive.
        I personally see Windows only usable for gaming related things, I cannot imagine myself doing serious work in
        Windows.<br><br>

        Besides Linux, I am also interested in Python, as it is a simple scripting language, that can do a lot of things.
        I find Python an ideal fit when it comes to AI-related things, which is also another area of interest.<br><br>

        Lastly, I am interested in open source software. Whenever I can, I use software that was released under a FSF
        conform license.
        This, however, is not always possible. Even the Technical University of Vienna sometimes forces its students to use
        proprietary software.
        I have a guideline that using proprietary software in my browser is rather acceptable.
        The only system wide installations of such software are hardware drivers and IDEs like IntelliJ Ultimate (there
        simply is no alternative that is even close to it).
      </p>

      <h1><u>What I do in my free time</u></h1>
      <p>
        I am someone who likes to spend time with his family and loved ones. I also have a partner, she is sweetest person I know, and I love her.<br><br>
      
        I am a strong believer that people should keep themselves physically fit and capable.
        This includes working out several times a week and eating clean most of the time.
        That is the reason why I religiously workout almost every day, primarily lifting weights, but I also enjoy boxing,
        running, hiking and playing football.
        When lifting weights, I focus on a good form.
        I exclusively train until I reach 80-100% of muscular failure.
        My favorite exercises are pull ups, flat bench press and the classical back squat.

        When I was younger, I was a relatively good football player.
        I played in the fourth Austrian league when I was 15-16 years old.
        Because my education was more important to me, I decided to quit football.
        However, I still play with friends every now and then.<br><br>

        I also enjoy the game of chess.
        Before I started playing chess, I just found it to be nerdy and geeky.
        I don't remember why I actually even started learning it, but surely I don't regret my decision.
        The thing I like about chess is that when losing, you and only you made a mistake, there is no such thing as luck.
        Every move has to be cleanly evaluated before it's being made.
        Albeit, outplaying an opponent is one of the most satisfying feelings there is.
